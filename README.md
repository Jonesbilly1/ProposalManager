# Overview
The Proposal Management process is built around three main entities – the Opportunity that gets processed by an internal team, the specific process/workflow identified to validate and move the opportunity forward, and the associated Proposal that is prepared as an outcome of the process.

An Opportunity is a potential deal identified by the Relationship Manager for one of his/her own clients based on knowledge gathered from customer discussions and market analysis. He then uses the Proposal Management process to convert the opportunity, by means of well-defined corporate lending processes and a hand-picked team of experts brought together to execute the process, to a proposal document that can then be presented to the customer, offering a loan or line of credit that they can use in line with the terms and conditions.

The Proposal Manager solution leverages the collaborative capabilities of Microsoft Teams to enable an end-to-end proposal management experience. The solution consists of three key add-in components:
  - Proposal Manager for Teams
  - Smart Link for Office
  - Proposal Creation for Office
